# Trump Tweet Generator
My Trump Tweet Generator was made with Gatsby.js, React, and vanilla Javascript. And the twitter data was scraped with a python twitter scraper.

## The Future

This is an old project I worked on during my time learning JavaScript. It is getting evolved into a bigger project with the Twitter API, that project is still in progress, but you may check it out at my github [repo](https://github.com/nmestrada/TweetGenerator)
